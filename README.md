# Introduction
Xalia is a program that provides a gamepad UI for traditional desktop applications. It does this using accessibility platforms like AT-SPI2 and UIAutomation, a unique rule-based language, the .NET standard, and SDL3.

Rather than directly simulate a keyboard or mouse through gamepad inputs (which can be done using AntiMicroX or Steam Input), Xalia scans the active window for controls it can interact with, such as buttons and text boxes. An analog joystick or D-Pad can then be used to navigate to a specific control. There is no virtual mouse cursor, it simply jumps to a control in the direction pressed. The way you then interact with the control depends on what it is, but in simple cases like buttons it can be activated with the A button by default.

Global actions are also possible, such as opening a program's menus or switching tabs, without needing to navigate to a specific control.

# Current Status

## Linux

Linux/X11 is supported using AT-SPI2.

Wayland is not supported. Currently, the accessibility architecture on Wayland doesn't have the capabilities needed to support Xalia.

## Windows

Windows is supported using Win32, MSAA, and UI Automation. Sometimes it is slow to respond to UI updates. The current Windows backend is an early WIP.

# Setup

The latest release can be downloaded from https://github.com/madewokherd/xalia/releases

## Linux

Requirements:
 * A .NET runtime. This can either be Mono or .NET 6. The "self-contained" archives contain a build of .NET 6. When using Mono, the "Facade" assemblies (which are needed to support .NET Standard applications) are required; for some reason, Ubuntu has them in the `mono-devel` package.
 * SDL3. This should just be a matter of installing the libsdl3 packages on your distribution.
 * AT-SPI2. This is probably included with your desktop environment, but you will need to enable it.

You will need to enable AT-SPI2. On XFCE, this can be done by starting "Accessibility" in the applications menu and enabling the checkbox labeled "Enable assistive technologies". On Plasma, the option is in Accessibility settings under the Screen Reader tab, misleadingly named "Screen reader enabled". You will need to log in again for the change to take effect.

For Qt applications, you may need to run this command:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled true
```
or set the environment variable `QT_LINUX_ACCESSIBILITY_ALWAYS_ON=1`.

Once all of the setup is complete, run `mono xalia.exe`, `dotnet xalia.dll`, or './xalia' in a terminal, depending on which build you are using. To quit, press Ctrl+C in the terminal. There is no GUI available for configuration and starting/stopping the program yet, but hopefully that will change in the future.

## Windows

Run `xalia.exe` from the net48-mono or net9-windows zip.

If you are using 32-bit Windows, you will need to use the net48-mono build and replace SDL3.dll with a win32-x86 version from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest.

# Building

SDL.dll from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases need to be dropped into the `xalia` project directory before building.

The single-assembly version (which works on both Linux/Mono and Windows/.NET Framework 4.8), can be built from xalia.sln using Visual Studio.

On a Linux machine, the single-assembly version can be built with
```
nuget restore xalia.sln
msbuild xalia.sln
```

A .NET 8 version can be built with one of the following commands:

```
dotnet publish xalia-netcore.sln --runtime linux-x64 --configuration Release-Linux --self-contained
dotnet publish xalia-netcore.sln --runtime linux-x64 --configuration Release-Linux --no-self-contained
dotnet publish xalia-netcore.sln --runtime win-x64 --configuration Release-Windows --self-contained
dotnet publish xalia-netcore.sln --runtime win-x64 --configuration Release-Windows --no-self-contained
```

# Default Gamepad Controls

Here are the default controls when using a gamepad:
 * **D-Pad** or **Left Stick**: Navigate between controls or within menus.
 * **A (or bottom face button)**: Activate the targeted control or menu.
 * **B (or right face button)**: Exit a submenu, click the Close/Cancel/No button if one exists, or press Escape (if the current window has any control that Xalia can interact with).
 * **X (or left face button)**: Secondary action for the selected control, currently this opens a virtual keyboard when a combo box containing a text field is targeted, or double-clicks on list items.
 * **Y (or top face button)**: Activate the context menu of the targeted control, or right-click.
 * **Start**: Toggle the application menu, click the OK/Yes button if one exists, or press Enter (if the current window has any control that Xalia can interact with).
 * **Back/Select**: Cycle through controls.
 * **Right Stick**: Adjust the selected control (for scrollbars and slider controls), or scroll the view.
 * **LB (or front left shoulder button)** and **RB (or front right shoulder button)**: Switch to the previous or next tab respectively.

This is based on SDL3's GameController mapping, which should use the same layout for whatever controller you have, but the buttons may be labeled differently.

# GUDL

Controls and UI interactions are coded in a specialized language called GUDL. It looks a little bit like CSS. Here's some of the code (simplified) that supports combo boxes:

```css
if (interactable) {
    combo_box (not uia_expand_collapse_state.leaf_node) {
        targetable: true;

        primary_action: spi_action.(press or Press) or uia_expand;
        primary_action_name: "Select";

        if (child_matches(text_box)) {
            secondary_action: child_matches(text_box).set_focus + show_keyboard;
            secondary_action_name: "Show Keyboard";
        }
    }
}
```

The language works based on pattern-matching. In this example we are searching for an element with the combo_box role that is "interactable" (generally, in the active window while there isn't a menu open - the exact definition is defined within GUDL). All matching controls are marked as "targetable" which makes it possible to navigate to it. If the control is targeted, it also has actions defined on it. If a targeted combo box has a child with the "text" role then a secondary action to open an on-screen keyboard is defined.

All of these conditions are monitored, and if any of them changes (for example, a menu opens, making the combo box no longer "interactable"), the declarations inside no longer apply.

 # Debugging Environment Variables

`XALIA_DEBUG` can be set to a GUDL boolean expression selecting some elements, for which Xalia will output debugging information. For example, `XALIA_DEBUG=is_root` will output declarations on the root element. Currently, any properties used must be referenced inside `main.gudl` for this to work.

`XALIA_DEBUG_INPUT=1` displays gamepad inputs.

`XALIA_DEBUG_EXCEPTIONS=1` displays expected exceptions.

`XALIA_DEBUG_EVENTS=1` displays AT-SPI2 events. This will only work for the events Xalia listens to.

`XALIA_DEBUG_EVENT_*=1` displays a specific named AT-SPI2 event, for example `XALIA_DEBUG_EVENT_ATTRIBUTESCHANGED=1` will display all AttributesChanged events. This will only work for the events Xalia listens to.
